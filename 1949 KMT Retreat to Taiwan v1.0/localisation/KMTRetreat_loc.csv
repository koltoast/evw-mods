EVTNAME151020;Victory in the People's Liberation War!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC151020;Our People's Liberation Army, backed by the whole nation, has been fighting heroically and selflessly to defend the territorial sovereignty of our homeland, to protect the people's lives and property, and to relieve the people of their sufferings. Now, the People's War of Liberation has been essentially won, the reactionary rule of the Nationalist government overthrown, and the majority of the people in the country have been liberated. The Central People's Government Council has decided to declare to the governments of all other countries that our regime is the sole legal government representing all the people of the People's Republic of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA151020;A glorious day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME151021;People's Republic of China Declared;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC151021;After a number of successful campaigns against Nationalist forces which resulted in Communist control being extended across most of China, the Communist leadership has declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China from their new capital of Beijing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA151021;OK;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME151023;PRC-RoC Ceasefire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME151024;USA Blockades the Taiwan Strait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC151024;The imperialist United States has sent a fleet to blockade the Taiwan Strait, preventing us from dealing the final blow to the Nationalists cowering in Taiwan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC151025;Communist China has declared war on the USA, claiming that their stationing of a fleet in the Taiwan strait is an unjustifiable violation of their territorial waters and an act of war.

EVTDESC152050;With most of China now under their control, and their armies inflicting upon us defeat after defeat, the Communist bandits have declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China from their new capital of Beijing. Now we face two options, neither of them ideal: withdraw to Taiwan and develop the island as a future springboard for the reclamation of mainland China, or continue to fight on in the hinterlands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
